# data_science_fatecjdi
"This GitHub repository, data_science_fatecjdi, will document my journey through the Data Science degree at FATEC Jundia√≠. Here, I'll showcase projects and exercises from courses like Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Database Management. I'll be utilizing Python (with libraries like Pandas and Scikit-learn), R, and SQL, and exploring cloud technologies. Expect to find projects focusing on data visualization, predictive modeling, and data cleaning. My goal is to build a solid understanding of data science concepts and apply them to real-world challenges. I'm particularly excited about data science and hope to contribute to projects in this domain. Feel free to connect and collaborate!"
